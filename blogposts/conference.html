            <h2>Project Organisation</h2>

            <h3>Idea finding</h3>

            <p class="blogpost">In December of 2016 I invited a few people to meet up and do a brainstorming session. Some of those people were my friends,
            others I had just met once or twice before. Around 10 people showed up, only three of which would remain
            active and involved in some way until the end of the project. I told them I wanted to organise a conference,
            either on how to teach technology (so a didactic viewpoint), or on how technology is used as a tool
            in activism projects and I collected their input and ideas. There was something of an agreement between a few of us,
            that what was really important when learning tech is to meet a community, and to have a spirit of wanting to continue learning, of wanting to get better.
            We also thought that the talks at this conference should transfer the enthusiasm that we had for tech unto the audience.</p>

            <h3>Funding</h3>

            <p class="blogpost">Start with funding as early as you can. From my previous experiences with the environmental project and my diploma project, I knew applying for fundings was a really
            good way of getting a budget, so I applied for the ÖH Funding (Link) as soon as possible after we had something of an idea what we wanted to do.
            Depending on the amount of the funding you are expected to write up a detailed application, which can range from two pages (eureprojekte) to 60 pages (EU Fundings). They force you to really think
            through your budget and time plans, which is actually a good thing. In the end we received two fundings. Good to know about these kind of fundings are that while you are getting money for your project, they are
            also a <em>* responsibility *</em> . You are expected to be open and communicate your project to the Funder, to manage your finances so that you have a proper accounting to show them after the project is done and after the project is over,
            to finalize it with reports.
            Of course things are still going to change during your project, and there a lot of factors you cannot influence or know anything
            about at this point of the project. However formulating your ideas in a presentable way, making them more concrete, helps a lot with knowing the direction the project will go in.
            What was completely new for me in this project was working with sponsors, and our project was not the easiest to sell to sponsors. For a tech conference you usually look for tech companies to pitch in with money,
            however most tech companies are interested in selling themselves to a tech audience which has some potential future employees among them. Having a crowd of all tech beginners, which might only be hireable within the next 2 to 10 years,
            is usually not their target group, so we had a lot of companies declining our sponsor requests. We got extremely lucky with Github sponsoring us, as one of their missions is to strengthen the tech community.
            We also got extremely lucky with them sending us over some amazing speakers from the US. In general I gained a lot of respect for what they do and how strong of a motivated community they seem to have.</p>

            <p class="blogpost">We have made the experience that rather than asking sponsors for money, it seems to be better to ask for something concrete, like electronics or food. Konrad supplied us with a huge box full of Electronics for one of our Workshops, which we are going to pass on to a school for the students to learn with.</p>

            <p class="blogpost">On a more general note, when handling money it does make sense to make a bank account only for the event money (we used N26 for this, since they are free) to have a clear seperation of concerns. Moreover, we founded an association, for legal reasons, since otherwise we would have had to pay taxes on any incoming sponsor money.</p>

            <h3>Don´t search too long :</h3>

            <p class="blogpost">Location was a tough one for us. We wrote out a lot of emails, to different spaces in Vienna and we had the hope that someone would host us for free.
            We almost had a free location at my University and actually already had a "Yes" from quite a few parties there, until they told us it was logistically impossible to give us a concrete "Yes" until the new semester started (Which was way too late).
            After a tip from the organisers of another tech-conference, I contacted the ImpactHub. They made us a fair offer, but it was not free and at this point we had no money. So we kept them waiting, still looked around, waited for replies on emails.
            At some point we decided we had to stop looking, if we ever wanted to get this done. We just had to say yes, and figure out the How later. Worst case, we were going to pay for it ourselves. This decision helped us catch up on a lot of lost times, and to move ahead.
            Sometimes the best thing is to just settle on something, even if it isnt what you originally wanted, just so you can finally move on and don`t get stuck. The ImpactHub turned out to be wonderful location, with a great atmosphere and helpful&amp;approachable staff.</p>

            <h3>Advertising</h3>

            <p>When applying for funding</p>

            <h3>Teamwork</h3>

            <p class="blogpost">Personally this was the hardest one for me, and I think it is definitely one of the biggest challenges in Volunteer work in general. How do you get people, who have jobs or studies and very limited free time, to spend their free time working even more?</p>

            <p class="blogpost">There were a few things I knew before and thought I could implement in trying to keep people involved in the project. The first thing I thought was relevant, is to give concrete tasks. Back when we organised the environmental project, our project leader
            often approached us at the end of a meeting with "Can you do this task until this deadline?" and that worked quite well for us. The second thing I knew was that you have to give people a feeling of involvement and responsibility for the project.
            In the environmental project we had fairly regular personal meetings, but also did stuff together in our free time. We had quite a strong bond, with the project connecting us. This, again, seemed to work quite well.
            However, personal meetings are extremely difficult if everyone is busy, and they are quite often not very efficient. They take at least one or two hours, often times longer and it is time that could be invested actually getting work done. Which obviously is a general problem of meetings.</p>

            <p class="blogpost">What I have learned during trying to get people involved, is that it does not necessarily help to give out concrete tasks. Often times it takes longer to explain what you want to someone else, than just doing it yourself. And giving one concrete task does not necessarily reduce the load of responsibility on yourself.
            On the contrary it can make it even harder, because now I was not in control anymore, I had to wait for the other person to finish, I had to check back with them, remind them and ultimately the result might be different to what I wanted. What I personally take from this, is that if someone wants to help with a project, I need them to take responsiblity of one part of the project.
            This includes making decisions, making plans on what is needed, planning actions and setting things into motion. Only then, the load is actually taken off yourself. Otherwise you still have to keep all the strings connected in your head and have all the information and management done on your site.</p>

            <h2>On-Site</h2>

            <p class="blogpost">The event itself went quite smoothly, all the speakers appeared, all the workshops took place, everything arrived on time and we had a lot of help. We got quite a lot of positive feedback, and personally I really enjoyed the atmosphere which developed over the course of the day.
            The biggest disappointment for me were the number of participants. We had a 140 registrations (With the talk room fitting about a 100 people), out of which around 50 showed up. Of course I had been expecting less people to show up
            then were registered, since it was a completely free event. However I was not expecting this low of a number. It was actually quite frustrating to me, because we did have a waiting list of about 25 people, who did not get a ticket, but might have actually shown up. The second reason why this was frustrating for me,
            was because while all the Workshops were completely packed, there weren`t that many people at most of the talks. The talks itself were absolutely amazing, and I really wished that more people could hear them, that the knowledge and enthusiasm could reach a bigger crowd. The things spoken about were important, cool and inspiring, and I will be forever grateful for the presenters.
            It is just too bad not more people heard them speak. I also really wish we would have had some way to record them at least.
            However, this smaller crowd also had a big upsite: The people who were actually there, were really, really there. They were asking questions, listening closely, interacting and speaking to eachother. The atmosphere to me seemed extremely open, almost everyone seemed to speak to everyone else including the speakers themselves. And some wonderful things happened, I would have probably never
            noticed in a bigger crowd such as:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>A family arriving with both their small children. Actually the mother was the one signing up for the conference, because she was interested in teaching her children to code. Her husband arrived later and it ended up so that her husband was the one disappearing into the Workshops and getting caught up in the conference.</li>

            <li>One of my friends who was volunteering borrowing his laptop to said husband so he could participate in the Game Development Workshop</li>

            <li>One participant wrote to us before, saying he was on the waiting list but really wanted to attend, since he thought the conference was just the thing for him. Thankfully, since we had a few cancellations we were able to give him a ticket. He introduced himself to me at the conference and he was this really awesome, motivated guy that stayed until almost the end and we had some great discussions on technology.</li>

            <li>Said participant buying cheese to eat with all the bread we got from Ströck, and since not being able to finish this whole package of cheese on his own, started passing cheese around to everyone. Another one of my friends volunteering later took the remainders of cheese home with her.</li>

            <li>A group of 15 year olds from my old school hijacking the Workshops and having lots of fun waving around their self-built 3D printed hands.</li>

            <li>The Afterparty where pretty much everyone who remained until the end of the day joined in, where speakers and participants had wonderful discussions and Pizza</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="blogpost">I was very, very tired during the event and whenever I had a free minute I was sitting somewhere in half-coma, but I heard many more stories from my friends (aka The Volunteers), and it really seemed people were engaging and motivating eachother.
            Even when it did not reach as many people as I had hoped it would, I do feel it was quite a success, simply because the ones who were there seemed to be enjoying themselves, which is actually the most important thing.</p>

            <h2>Personal Take-Aways</h2>
            <ul>
            <li> Organising kept me away from doing what I actually love, which is tech</li>
            <li> Communicating to an audience, or to strangers is definitely harder than I thought</li>
            </ul>
